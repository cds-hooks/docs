# CDS Hooks Cheat Sheet

Whether for general development or distribution at events, it's helpful to have a concise "cheat sheet" as a reminder of essential structures and syntax.  The [Markdown version](./cheat-sheet.md) in this folder is meant to provide the *source of truth content* for such a doument, leaving further formatting and arrangement up to the consumer.

A rendered version created by [Firely](https://fire.ly/) based on the markdown is also available within this folder and linked to in the navigation section.
