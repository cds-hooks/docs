## Workflow

This hook is invoked when the user is initiating a new encounter.  In an inpatient setting, this would be the time of admission.  In an outpatient/community environment, this would be the time of patient-check-in for a face-to-face or equivalent for a virtual/telephone encounter.  The Encounter should either be in one of the following states: `planned` | `arrived` | `triaged` | `in-progress`.  Note that there can be multiple 'starts' for the same encounter as each user becomes engaged.  For example, when a scheduled encounter is presented at the beginning of the day for planning purposes, when the patient arrives, when the patient first encounters a clinician, etc.  Hooks may present different information depending on user role and Encounter.status.

Note: This is distinct from the `patient-view` hook which occurs any time the patient's record is looked at - which might be done outside the context of any encounter and will often occur during workflows that are not linked to the initiation of an encounter.

The intention is that the cards from any invoked CDS Services are available at the time when decisions are being made about what actions are going to occur during this encounter.  For example, identifying that the patient is due for certain diagnostic tests or interventions, identifying additional information that should be collected to comply with protocols associated with clinical studies the patient is enrolled in, identifying any documentation or other requirements associated with patient insurance, etc.
