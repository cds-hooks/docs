# Deferring Cards

CDS Services return guidance in real-time in response to user workflow actions. Depending upon the content of the card and the native capability of the CDS Client, the end-user may be able to defer or "snooze" a card to act upon later. 

CDS Hooks does not mandate CDS Client user interface nor capabilities; depending upon the UI capabilities of the CDS Client, the user may be able to defer or ignore a card and then return to it later. There are important considerations for CDS Clients considering enabling this, some are listed below.
