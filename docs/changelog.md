## CDS Hooks 1.1
### Non-compatible (breaking) changes
The CDS Hooks project team strives to not brek backward compatibility between versions of the CDS Hooks specifications to aid both in interoperability 
and to prioritize existing implementations. In cases where this isn't possible, changes made in the CDS Hooks 1.1 specification that break backward compatibility are documented below.
